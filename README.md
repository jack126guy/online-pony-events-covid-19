# Online Pony Events During the COVID-19 Pandemic

This dataset documents the various online events in the brony/*My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic* fandom that have sprung up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the same vein as the existing spreadsheet for physical conventions.

The dataset is also available as a [Google Sheets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FQ3Jcje9d7Uq3ZsbXYXfWsozFFxMxqDPxie7MajOZRs/edit).

## Format

The data files are CSV (mostly following [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180), except non-ASCII characters may be introduced as UTF-8) with headers.

Timestamps use an "almost ISO 8601" format for convenience. To get an ISO 8601 timestamp, replace the space with a "T" and optionally add a "Z" at the end to indicate that it is UTC.

Some conventions have only announced dates and not actual times. In these cases, only the date is present to reflect the inherent ambiguity. Importantly, a date alone does not mean "sometime between 00:00 and 23:59 UTC."
